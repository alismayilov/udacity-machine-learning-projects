    "### Implementation: Feature Scaling\n",
    "If data is not normally distributed, especially if the mean and median vary significantly (indicating a large skew), it is most [often appropriate](http://econbrowser.com/archives/2014/02/use-of-logarithms-in-economics) to apply a non-linear scaling — particularly for financial data. One way to achieve this scaling is by using a [Box-Cox test](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/generated/scipy.stats.boxcox.html), which calculates the best power transformation of the data that reduces skewness. A simpler approach which can work in most cases would be applying the natural logarithm.\n",

    " - Assign a copy of the data to `log_data` after applying a logarithm scaling. Use the `np.log` function for this.\n",

    "Detecting outliers in the data is extremely important in the data preprocessing step of any analysis. The presence of outliers can often skew results which take into consideration these data points. There are many \"rules of thumb\" for what constitutes an outlier in a dataset. Here, we will use [Tukey's Method for identfying outliers](http://datapigtechnologies.com/blog/index.php/highlighting-outliers-in-your-data-with-the-tukey-method/): An *outlier step* is calculated as 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR). A data point with a feature that is beyond an outlier step outside of the IQR for that feature is considered abnormal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Assign the value of the 25th percentile for the given feature to `Q1`. Use `np.percentile` for this.\n",
    " - Assign the value of the 75th percentile for the given feature to `Q3`. Again, use `np.percentile`.\n",
    " - Assign the calculation of an outlier step for the given feature to `step`.\n",
    " - Optionally remove data points from the dataset by adding indices to the `outliers` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** If you choose to remove any outliers, ensure that the sample data does not contain any of these points!  \n",
